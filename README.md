# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Resource management in projects. The idea, using a software development project as a template, is to use AI to distribute tasks, and track progress within
the project. You need to have a list of assets(people) and their skills described as completeley as possible. Then, after detailing a new project the AI will
determine which personell is best suited for each task within the project. It will also determine the appropriate number of people and estimate how much
time it will take.
The AI will then track the progress of the project through the project management system where people update their progress regularly, and use this information as training data.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This solves two main problems in projects in general. Predicting the cost, and allocating resources efficiently.
Predicting costs will become more and more accurate as the system can compare previous predictions with actual costs, down to the individual level.
Allocation of resources can at the outset be done without personal bias, and will improve over time as the system can both measure efficiency directly and encorporate anonymous feedback on how people in certain roles affect their work.

## How is it used?

This could be used in any organisation that routinely runs projects with different people working toghether on each project. The only requirement is that
each persons skill set can be quantified.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data would need to come from people using the system as a straight project management tool at first, but data from all users could be used to train the AI, not just from within your own organisation.

## Challenges

I don't see anything particular it doesn't solve, but care should be taken to not single out low performers. Some element of randomness should maybe be implemented so that people have a chance to grow, i.e. be given a management role even if someone else is a little better suited.

## What next?

Would first need help assesing the idea, and then help developing it.
